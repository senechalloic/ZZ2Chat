## Report

We realized a web chat. It is programmed in **HTML**, **PHP**, **Javascript** and **CSS**. It was our first website so we learnt everything from scratch with internet.

We encountered few **issues**. Javascript is hard to understand, however HTML was very to learn. 
Our main issues were:
  * **Ajax**: To show asynchronously the messages.
  * **Javascript**: To read into file asyncronously. It's still a problem as the website sometimes doesn't respond. Solution: not found yet.
  * **PHPunit**: To test the code as our teacher wanted. Because we don't know how to use it, and it requires functions in PHP files that we didn't create. Solution: not found yet.

We also have **perspectives**. We could add the possibilities to:
  * **Send private messages**. By creating different pages or good usage of PHP and Javascript.
  * **Filter IP adresses** that try to login or to subscribe. In order to avoid too many request that would try to crack the password for exemple.
  * **Change the profile animal picture**, for an other animal.
